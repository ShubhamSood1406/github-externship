# Shubham's application to the Upptime GitHub Externship

Hello, Developers! My name is Shubham Sood and I want to apply to this externship because it will help in strengthening my skills and learning about other new demanding technologies. It gives me the opportunity to expand my development skills as I will have to work on real-world projects and perceive creative ways to solve the problem and also from this I can enhance the organizational skills. organization. From this opportunity, I can also be able to share my knowledge with the other fellows so that we all can learn something or other from each other.

I have experience in HTML, CSS and MERN Stack and made a few personal projects based on them and I believe I can help to contribute to your organization with these skills and will learn more about other technologies as and when needed.

Thanks to Github Program and Koj that it would be a great learning opportunity for me to work with your organization.

# Ideas that I am thinking of

I am thinking about adding some more website in this project like Twitter or Discord and I am also wondering about analyzing and reporting issues based on the response time based on a certain location, so that it will help other also to see whether that particular website is down or not at that same location (but I'm not certain if response time based on server location can affect the status).

# Time

I am ready to devote 15 to 20 hours per week to this project.
